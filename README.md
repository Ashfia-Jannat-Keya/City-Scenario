# City-Scenario
A project of computer graphics course. Developed with C++ and OpenGL.
We tried to make a graphically designated City Scenario. The Graphic Designated City Scenario is made with the application of Graphics codes and drawing algorithms. The main feature of our project is to just create a simple animation of a city. We tried to draw many objects like buildings, trees, grass, bench, cars, road, traffic light, ship, sun, sky, birds, plane to create a simple animation of a city.
Other features:
1.	Both day and night animation can be seen.
2.	Cloud and plane will move in opposite direction of each other in day.
3.	Birds will fly towards the sky.
4.	A ship will move in the river and cars in the road.
5.	A comet will fly in the sky at night.
6.	Lights of the buildings can be turned off or on.
